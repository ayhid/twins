# /dev-init — configure the dev workflow for this project

Produces one file, `.dev-workflow.json` at the repo root. Everything `/dev-task`, `/dev-bug` and
`/dev-done` need that is project-specific lives there; nothing under `_dev-workflow/` is edited per
project.

`dw init` — `dw` is `claude-dev-workflow`, the binary from `brew install claude-dev-workflow` or
`npm install -g claude-dev-workflow`; or `npx claude-dev-workflow@latest` with nothing installed —
runs a CLI wizard that covers **both trackers** deterministically:
it asks which one the project uses first, then reads YouTrack's real state names off the API, or a
GitHub repository's real labels off `gh`. If the user would rather click through prompts than talk,
point them at it and stop.

Come here instead to amend an existing config, to repair one a command is complaining about, or
when the user would rather answer in prose. What follows produces the same file the wizard does.

## 1. Check what already exists

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/_dev-workflow/scripts/dev.mjs" config
```

If a config file is already reported, show it and ask whether to amend or replace it. Never
overwrite an existing `.dev-workflow.json` without saying what will change. The first line of the
summary is the provider, so an existing setup tells you which branch of §4 applies.

## 2. Find out what kind of project this is

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/_dev-workflow/scripts/dev.mjs" assess
```

What makes a project brownfield is that **there is already something here** — code, or
documentation describing it. So the source files, their size and the documentation *decide*, and
the history (commits, age, contributors) only corroborates. That order matters: `git init` on a
codebase somebody has built for years produces one commit, one author and an age of zero, which is
how most existing projects arrive at version control.

It **proposes** and never decides: put the verdict to the user, let them correct it, then record the
answer as `stage` in the config so it is settled once.

The two need different first moves:

- **greenfield** — carry on below. There is nothing to learn yet.
- **brownfield** — there is a codebase full of decisions here, some written down and some of those
  no longer true. Finish this configuration first, then say that `/dev-ingest-docs` will read the
  existing documentation into a verified map, and offer to run it. **Do not start it from here** —
  it runs over multiple sessions, and re-running `/dev-init` later to change one config value must
  not drag anybody back into a survey.

## 3. Probe the repo before asking anything

Answer as much as you can from the project itself, and only ask about the rest:

- **Repo layout** — is this one repo or several sibling apps? `ls`, then look for `package.json`,
  `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `composer.json`, `Gemfile` at the root and one level
  down. Nested `.git` directories mean separate repos, not a monorepo.
- **Check commands** — read the `scripts` block of each `package.json` (or the Makefile, or
  `pyproject.toml`) for the real test / lint / type-check entry points. Prefer a single-run
  target over a watch-mode one; note which is which.
- **Package manager** — a `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` or a
  `packageManager` field settles it. Cross-manager use is a common failure, so record it.
- **Node/tool pinning** — `.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, `mise.toml`. If a pin cannot be resolved by
  the version manager in use, that is exactly the sort of thing the `env` field exists to record.
- **Commit convention** — `commitlint.config.*`, `.commitlintrc*`, `.czrc`, `package.json#commitlint`
  give the allowed types and scopes verbatim. Use those, not the defaults.
- **Base branch** — `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` or `git branch -r`.
- **Remotes** — `git remote -v` per repo. More than one remote usually means branches push to both.
- **Existing conventions** — `git log --oneline -30` shows how issue IDs actually appear in
  subjects on this project, which beats any assumption about prefix vs suffix. It also hints at the
  tracker: `ABC-123` is YouTrack-shaped, `#123` is GitHub-shaped.

## 4. Ask only what the repo cannot tell you

**First, settle the tracker**, because it decides everything else:

> Which issue tracker does this project use — YouTrack, or GitHub Issues?

If `git remote -v` shows a GitHub remote and the commit log carries `#123`, propose GitHub and let
them correct you. Then ask the rest in one batch.

### Common to both

1. **Language for ticket prose** — the language issues are written in, which is often not the
   language the session is conducted in. Default to English if they have no preference.
2. **State ladder** — the states this project moves through, and specifically which one means
   *started*, which means *in review*, which means *finished*, and which one a ticket goes **back**
   to when its work is thrown away (`states.abandon`, what `dev.mjs abandon` uses). That last one is
   usually the first rung — `Backlog`, `Open`, `Submitted` — and it has no default: everything else
   in the tool only ever moves a ticket forward, so a wrong value here is a mistake nothing else
   will correct. If the project has no such state, leave it out; `abandon` then says which key to
   add and nothing else is affected.
3. **How work should reach the base branch.** Ask it in plain terms, because it is a working-style
   question, not a technical one:

   > When a ticket is finished, should it go through a pull request, or land straight on `<base>`?
   > (A solo project usually wants the second — there is nobody to review it.)

   → `delivery.mode`: `pr` or `direct`. Only ask for a **reviewer** if they chose `pr`; a reviewer
   on a `direct` project is a field nothing will ever read.

4. **Where a ticket gets checked out.**

   > Should starting a ticket create a separate working directory (a git worktree), or switch this
   > checkout to the new branch?

   → `branch.mode`: `worktree` or `branch`. Default to `worktree` and say why: starting a ticket
   never disturbs uncommitted work, and `/dev-bug` can file against the running tree while another
   ticket is in progress. If they pick it, tell them to add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` — the
   workflow will not write that file itself.

5. **Branch naming.** Propose `<type>/<ID>-<slug>` and show a rendered example for this project.
   The `<type>` comes from a mapping of issue type onto **commit type**, so the branch and the
   commits on it share one vocabulary:

   ```
   Bug → fix    Feature → feat    Task → chore
   ```

   Every value must be one of the project's `commit.types`, which step 2 already detected. If the
   project has an existing convention in `git branch -a`, propose that instead — an established
   naming scheme beats a tidier one.

### YouTrack only

6. **Instance URL** and **project key** (the short prefix in issue IDs, e.g. `RMB`).
7. **Token source** — `$YOUTRACK_TOKEN`, or a 1Password ref (`op://Vault/item/credential`).
   Never ask them to paste the token itself.

YouTrack projects differ wildly on state names; some have no `Fixed`/`Closed` at all.

### GitHub only

6. **Which repository holds the issues** — `owner/name`. If the project spans several repos this is
   required and not a default: `#123` means a different issue in every repository.
7. **Which label marks each rung.** GitHub has no state field, so the ladder is modelled with
   labels, and the mapping is required rather than inferred — a label named after its rung is a
   guess that is right often enough to be dangerous.

   Read the repo's real labels first rather than proposing names:

   ```bash
   gh label list -R <owner/name> --limit 100
   ```

   If suitable labels already exist, map to them. If not, agree the names and **ask before creating
   them** — adding labels to someone's repository is a visible, permanent change:

   ```bash
   gh label create "status: in progress" -R <owner/name> --color ededed
   ```

8. **The first rung needs no label.** A GitHub ladder must start with a rung meaning "untouched" —
   `Backlog`, say — because that is what an issue carrying no ladder label *is*. Without it every
   unlabelled issue would read as in-progress. This is why `states.ladder` is required for GitHub
   and optional for YouTrack.

## 5. Verify the credentials before writing anything

### YouTrack

```bash
YOUTRACK_BASE_URL=<url> YOUTRACK_PROJECT=<key> \
  node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/_dev-workflow/scripts/dev.mjs" create --dup-check "test"
```

A `no open issues matched` line or a list of issues both mean success. An auth or project error
means the config is wrong — fix it now rather than writing a file that fails on first use.

To confirm the state names, fetch any real issue with `dev.mjs fetch` and read the `State` line. Do
not invent state names: a state YouTrack does not recognise returns 400, or worse, 200 without
applying anything.

### GitHub

There is no token to verify — authentication is whatever `gh` already has:

```bash
gh auth status
gh --version          # 2.28 or newer
gh repo view <owner/name> --json nameWithOwner,viewerPermission
```

`viewerPermission` must not be `READ`; the workflow writes. The version floor is not cosmetic:
below 2.28 `gh` omits `stateReason`, and every closed issue then reads as *done* — which would
report work closed as *not planned* as if it had shipped.

Then write the file and confirm the mapping round-trips:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/_dev-workflow/scripts/dev.mjs" fetch "#<any existing issue>"
```

The `State:` line must show a rung from the agreed ladder. If it shows the first rung for an issue
you know is in progress, a label is mapped wrongly.

## 6. Write `.dev-workflow.json`

Everything except the provider-specific block below has a working default; omit what does not apply.

### YouTrack

```json
{
  "provider": "youtrack",
  "baseUrl": "https://acme.youtrack.cloud",
  "project": "ABC",
  "tokenOpRef": "op://Private/youtrack/credential",
  "language": "English",
  "stage": "brownfield",
  "states": {
    "start": "In Progress",
    "review": "In Review",
    "done": "Done",
    "abandon": "Open",
    "ladder": ["Submitted", "Open", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done"]
  },
  "issueTypes": ["Bug", "Feature", "Task", "Epic", "Improvement"],
  "priorities": ["Show-stopper", "Critical", "Major", "Normal", "Minor"],
  "defaultPriority": "Normal"
}
```

### GitHub

```json
{
  "provider": "github",
  "github": {
    "repo": "acme/api",
    "issuesRepo": "acme/api",
    "labels": {
      "In Progress": "status: in progress",
      "In Review": "status: review",
      "Done": "status: done"
    }
  },
  "language": "English",
  "stage": "brownfield",
  "states": {
    "ladder": ["Backlog", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done"],
    "start": "In Progress",
    "review": "In Review",
    "done": "Done",
    "abandon": "Backlog"
  },
  "commit": { "position": "suffix" }
}
```

`issuesRepo` may be omitted when it equals `repo` and the project is a single repo. There is no
`baseUrl`, no `tokenOpRef` and no `priorities`: GitHub has no ordered priority concept, and
`/dev-bug` will say so rather than pretend. No `commit.idPattern` either — the `#123` shape follows
`provider`, in the hook as well as the runtime, so writing one is an override, not a requirement.

### The rest, common to both

```json
{
  "branch": {
    "pattern": "<type>/<ID>-<slug>",
    "base": "main",
    "mode": "worktree",
    "worktreeDir": ".worktrees",
    "types": { "Bug": "fix", "Feature": "feat", "Task": "chore" },
    "fallbackType": "chore"
  },
  "delivery": { "mode": "pr", "remote": "origin", "push": true, "cleanup": true },
  "commit": {
    "pattern": "type(scope): description (<ID>)",
    "position": "suffix",
    "noTicketEscape": "chore(no-ticket)",
    "types": ["feat", "fix", "docs", "refactor", "test", "chore"],
    "scopes": ["api", "ui", "config"],
    "enforce": true,
    "requireType": true
  },
  "reviewer": "octocat",
  "repos": [
    {
      "path": "frontend",
      "when": "UI, pages, forms, translations, components",
      "checks": ["pnpm test:ci", "pnpm lint", "pnpm type-check"],
      "env": { "ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION": "22.22.0" },
      "remotes": ["origin", "upstream"]
    }
  ],
  "notes": ["Anything a future session must know that the code does not say."]
}
```

Field notes:

- `stage` is `greenfield` or `brownfield`, settled by the user in §2 and never inferred later. On a
  brownfield project it is what tells a session there is existing documentation worth reading before
  starting work — `/dev-ingest-docs` turns that into a verified map.
- `states.ladder` stops a session inventing a state that does not exist. `start` / `review` / `done`
  are the three rungs the skills actually apply, and they are what the commands take — no skill ever
  passes a raw state name. `states.abandon` is the fourth rung and the only one with no default: it
  is where `dev.mjs abandon` walks a ticket back to.
- `branch.pattern` takes `<type>`, `<ID>` and `<slug>`; a token you leave out is never rendered, so
  `"<ID>-<slug>"` keeps the pre-gitflow names exactly. The branch is what `/dev-done` and `sync`
  read the ticket back out of, so `<ID>` should stay in it.
- `branch.types` maps an **issue** type to a **commit** type, and every value must be one of
  `commit.types` — that is what stops the branch saying `feature/` while its commits say `feat`. An
  issue whose type is not in the map is an error naming the key to add, not a guess.
- `branch.mode: "worktree"` checks each ticket out under `worktreeDir` and leaves this checkout
  alone; `"branch"` switches in place and refuses when the tree is dirty. Add `.worktrees/` to
  `.gitignore` yourself — the workflow writes only `_dev-workflow/`, `.claude/skills/dev-*` and
  `.claude/agents/dev-*.md`.
- `delivery.mode: "direct"` rebases onto `branch.base`, fast-forwards it and pushes, instead of
  opening a pull request. `repos[].delivery` overrides it per repo, so a monorepo can push a library
  straight to `main` while its app still goes through review.
- `commit.idPattern` is a **POSIX ERE**, not a PCRE: the commit hook is bash, where `\b` and `\d` do
  not exist. Omit it and the hook uses the shape implied by the provider.
- `commit.position` is `suffix`, `prefix` or `any`, and the commit hook enforces it.
  `commit.enforce: false` disables the hook entirely; `commit.requireType: false` keeps the
  issue-ID check but drops the conventional-commit one.
- `commit.types` and `commit.scopes` should be **copied from the project's commitlint config**, not
  guessed — the hook and the model both read them.
- `repos` empty (or absent) means a single repo at the project root. With entries, `when` is the
  routing rule `/dev-task` uses to pick a repo and `checks` is what `/dev-done` runs there.
- `env` is prepended to every command run in that repo. Use it for pins the version manager cannot
  resolve on its own.
- `notes` is free-form and is shown to the model on every `/dev-task`, `/dev-bug` and `/dev-done`.

## 7. Confirm it loads, and tell them what is next

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/_dev-workflow/scripts/dev.mjs" config
```

Read the summary back and check it matches what was agreed — the provider line first, then the
instance or repo. Then:

- Suggest committing `.dev-workflow.json`. It holds no secret: YouTrack's `tokenOpRef` is a
  1Password *reference*, and GitHub keeps no credential here at all.
- **YouTrack:** if they chose `$YOUTRACK_TOKEN` over 1Password, remind them it must be exported in
  the shell Claude Code runs in, and must not be committed.
- **GitHub:** the ladder labels must exist in the repository. A missing one fails the transition
  with the exact `gh label create` command to fix it — it is never created behind their back.
- Point at `/dev-task <ID>` as the entry point.

## 8. Check the workflow itself is current

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/_dev-workflow/scripts/dev.mjs" version
```

Read-only, and it exits 0 with `unknown` rather than failing when there is no network — so a
non-zero exit or an error here is a real problem, not a bad connection.

If it reports an update available, **tell the user and stop there**:

- Give them the command it printed — `npx claude-dev-workflow@latest --update`, or
  `node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/_dev-workflow/scripts/dev.mjs" version --upgrade`, or `dw update`
  where the binary is installed.
- Say that it rewrites `_dev-workflow/`, `.claude/skills/dev-*` and `.claude/agents/dev-*.md`, all
  of which are committed, so it produces a diff they need to review and commit.
- **Never run `--upgrade` unasked**, and never while a ticket is in progress or the tree is dirty.
  `--upgrade` refuses on uncommitted changes in those directories anyway; do not work around it.

If it reports files differing from the manifest, name them. Those are hand edits to installer-managed
files: an update keeps them, which means it also keeps them stale.
