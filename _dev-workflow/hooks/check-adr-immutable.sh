# PreToolUse(Edit|Write) guard: an accepted decision record is superseded, never edited.
#
# An ADR records what was known and decided at a moment. Editing an accepted one
# rewrites that moment, and every citation of its number then points at
# reasoning nobody actually had. The replacement is `dev.mjs adr supersede`,
# which writes a new record and links the two in both directions.
#
# Exit 0 = allow. Exit 2 = block (stderr is surfaced to Claude).
#
# see docs/decisions/0001 — why this is a hook and not a command, and why Edit|Write
#
# Matcher is Edit|Write, not Bash. The commit hook runs on every Bash call and
# is built around a ~3ms bail for that reason; this one runs only on file
# writes, which are rare by comparison, so it can afford to read the target.
# The cost of that choice is a known gap: an ADR rewritten through `sed -i` or a
# shell heredoc is not seen here. Closing it would mean a Bash arm and the
# latency budget that comes with one — a decision to take when it has actually
# happened, not before.
#
# `dev.mjs adr` writes through node's fs, not through the Edit tool, so the
# supersede path is unaffected by this guard. That is deliberate: the tool that
# knows the rule is allowed to write; the tool that does not, is not.
