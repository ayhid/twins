/**
 * The documentation skeleton: which documents a project is meant to have, and
 * how one is rendered from the claims recorded against it.
 *
 * ## Why the set lives here and nowhere else
 *
 * The target set was written down twice before this file existed — once in the
 * issue that promised the skeleton, once in the issue that promised the
 * lifecycle around it — and the two copies had already disagreed about a name
 * (*runbook* against *operations (runbook)*) before either was implemented.
 * That is the drift this repo refuses everywhere else, which is why the
 * manifest has one writer and `branch.types` maps onto `commit.types` rather
 * than restating them. So the names, the filenames and the purposes are one
 * list, here, and `lib/config.mjs` imports its default from it rather than
 * spelling it again.
 *
 * ## Why `security-model.md` and not `security.md`
 *
 * `lib/ingest.mjs:63` excludes `/^security\.md$/i` from what counts as a
 * document, and tests it against the **basename**, before the `docs/` rule. The
 * exclusion was written for a root-level GitHub `SECURITY.md` policy file, but
 * as written it also swallows a real security document under `docs/`:
 * `classifyPath('docs/security.md')` is `other`, while
 * `classifyPath('docs/security-model.md')` is `doc`. A skeleton emitting the
 * first name would produce a file `ingest scan` never inventories.
 *
 * Narrowing that regex is a separate question — it changes what `ingest scan`
 * finds in every already-surveyed project — so the filename sidesteps it and
 * the reason is written down here, in `docs/configuration.md`, and pinned by a
 * test that renames it back to `security.md` and fails.
 *
 * ## Why the renderer has no free-prose slot
 *
 * "Read the repo and write the docs" produces prose nobody can falsify, and six
 * months later no one can tell which sentences are still true. `lib/ingest.mjs`
 * answered that for *reading* — the claim, with its anchor, is the atom — and
 * this is the same answer pointed the other way: ingest turns documents into
 * claims, `docs render` turns claims into documents. `renderDocument` takes
 * claims and emits bullets. There is no parameter a paragraph could be passed
 * through, so an unfalsifiable sentence is not discouraged, it is
 * unrepresentable.
 *
 * `lib/adr.mjs`'s renderer *does* have free prose, and that is not an
 * inconsistency: an ADR is dated, immutable, and never claims to describe the
 * present, so it cannot rot the way `architecture.md` rots. A document
 * asserting how the system is *now* must carry, per sentence, the thing that
 * would show it false.
 *
 * Pure: no fs, no argv, no clock. Dates in the output come from the ledger, so
 * the same ledger renders the same bytes a month later and `docs check` still
 * passes.
 */

/**
 * The set, defined once.
 *
 * `decisions` is a **pointer**, not a file this writes: decision records are
 * `lib/adr.mjs`'s job, numbered and frozen, and a second writer for them would
 * be exactly the duplication this file exists to prevent. It is in the
 * catalogue so the set is complete — a skeleton that silently omits decisions
 * reads as though a project needs none.
 *
 * The order is **reading order**, and that is what `DOC_KEYS` and so
 * `DEFAULT_DOC_SET` inherit: why the project exists, then its internals, then
 * the surfaces it presents, then how it is run, then the pointer.
 *
 * ## Why `api` is not part of `architecture`
 *
 * They rot at different speeds. An internal boundary moves when somebody
 * refactors; an external contract moves when somebody breaks a consumer. One
 * document carrying both is re-rendered on every refactor, so a reader cannot
 * tell from its mtime whether anything they depend on changed. Splitting them
 * is what makes each one checkable on its own.
 *
 * ## Why `context` and `ux` will hold mostly `intent` claims
 *
 * A goal is somebody's stated intent; there is no line of code that would show
 * "this is for self-hosting teams" false. So claims there carry an attributed
 * source rather than an anchor, which `KINDS` already models and
 * `docs/documentation.md` already argues for young projects. `api` is the
 * opposite case: a contract is anchorable to the file that declares it, so an
 * `observable` claim there with no anchor is a real error rather than a
 * concession.
