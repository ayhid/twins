/**
 * The documentation ledger: claims, contradictions and the questions only a
 * human can settle. No IO.
 *
 * ## Why a claim and not a document
 *
 * "Read the codebase and write the docs" produces prose nobody can falsify.
 * Six months later no one can tell which sentences are still true, so the whole
 * artifact rots at the speed of its worst line — and a session that trusts it
 * confidently reimplements something that already exists.
 *
 * So the atom here is a **claim**: one statement, plus where it came from, plus
 * an *anchor* — the `file:line` or command that would show it to be true — plus
 * its **kind**:
 *
 *   - `observable` — checkable against the tree. "The hook is registered in
 *     .claude/settings.json." Two of these disagreeing is a contradiction that
 *     can be located, and later, re-checked.
 *   - `intent` — why something is the way it is. "Worktree mode is the default
 *     so starting a ticket never disturbs uncommitted work." No amount of
 *     reading settles a disagreement between two of these; a person has to.
 *
 * That split is the whole design. It is what makes inconsistency detection
 * mechanical for the half that can be mechanical, and what keeps arbitration
 * down to the questions that genuinely need a human — because a process that
 * asks about everything gets abandoned on the first run.
 *
 * ## What this file refuses
 *
 * An `observable` claim with no anchor is refused rather than stored. It is the
 * one rule that keeps the map worth reading: an unanchored claim is a guess in
 * the voice of a fact, and a ledger of those is worse than no ledger, because
 * it reads exactly like one that was checked.
 *
 * Pure, so the format is asserted with no filesystem, the clock is a parameter,
 * and the same ledger always renders the same bytes.
