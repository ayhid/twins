 * files has someone edited since?". Two independent readers of one on-disk
 * schema is exactly the drift CLAUDE.md warns about for branch/commit types, so
 * the schema is understood in one place and that place ships.
 *
 * What deliberately does **not** live here: `isOwnedPath`, the write plan and the
 * delete pass. Those stay in `bin/lib/payload.mjs`, unshipped, so there is
 * exactly one implementation of the boundary that decides what the installer may
 * touch in someone's project.
 *
 * Zero dependencies: node: builtins only, like everything else under `lib/`.

 * `planFiles` happens not to plan an artifacts path today.
 *

 * before the check, since a hand-edited manifest may carry one. A `..` or empty
 * segment is rejected outright rather than normalized: `detectDrift` calls this
 * with no `isOwnedPath` gate ahead of it, unlike the delete pass, so this must
 * reject malformed paths on its own rather than borrow that rejection from a
