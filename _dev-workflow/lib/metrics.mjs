/**
 * One line per ticket transition, appended to a local file. No IO here.
 *
 * The thing being solved is that nothing in this workflow remembers. A ticket
 * takes three days or three weeks, gets restarted twice, closes with its
 * criteria met on the first pass or the fourth — and none of it survives the
 * session that did the work. This is the smallest thing that changes that: an
 * append-only log of the transitions that already happen, written locally and
 * sent nowhere.
 *
 * Pure, so the format is asserted without a filesystem and the clock is a
 * parameter (`lib/notes.mjs` for the same reason). The append itself lives in
 * `scripts/cmd/common.mjs`, at the one place every command's `setState` goes
 * through — six call sites would be six places to forget.
 *
 * ## What is recorded, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Three roles, named by rung and never by a backend's state name: `start`,
 * `done`, `abandon`. Abandoned work is recorded exactly like finished work,
 * because a log that only counts successes answers a question nobody asked.
 *
 * `starts` counts how many times the ticket entered the start rung in the
 * current cycle. It is called that rather than "retries" because that is what
 * it measures — the log can see restarts, and cannot see how many times a test
 * suite was run. `criteria` is the one field the code cannot observe at all: it
 * comes from `/dev-done`, which is the only thing that knows whether the
 * acceptance criteria passed first time, and it is null when nobody said.
 *
 * The file is a log, not a database. It is appended to, never rewritten, and a
 * line nothing can parse is skipped and counted rather than throwing — a
 * corrupt metrics file must never be able to stop a ticket from closing.
