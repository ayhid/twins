/**
 * Is a newer version of the workflow published than the one installed here?
 *
 * Two consumers, one implementation: `dev.mjs version` asks deliberately and
 * prints a full report, and the commands a session opens with — `config`,
 * `status`, `standup` — ask incidentally and print at most one line on stderr.
 * The registry lookup, the upgrade command's spelling and the cache all live
 * here so those two never drift into two different answers.
 *
 * Four rules this file exists to hold:
 *
 * 1. **It may never fail the command it rides on.** Offline, a non-200, an
 *    unparseable body, a corrupt cache, an unwritable `_config/` — each means no
 *    banner and nothing else. The host command's stdout, stderr and exit code
 *    are what they would have been. This is `lib/metrics.mjs`'s rule, for the
 *    same reason: an instrument that breaks what it measures is worse than none.
 * 2. **The network is touched at most once a day.** A session runs three of
 *    these commands; three lookups and three banners is how a notice gets tuned
 *    out. The cache holds the answer and the fact that it was already said.
 * 3. **IO is injected** — fetch, clock and file access (lib/provider.mjs rule
 *    1). Every branch below is testable with no network and no filesystem.
 * 4. **Silence is the default.** Up to date, ahead of the registry, no manifest,
 *    or anything unexpected: nothing is printed. Only a version this install is
 *    demonstrably behind produces a line.
 *
 * Zero dependencies: node: builtins only, like everything else under `lib/`.
