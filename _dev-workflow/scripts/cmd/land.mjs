/**
 * Get finished work onto the branch this project delivers onto.
 *
 *   dev.mjs land [ISSUE-ID] [--apply] [--repo PATH] [--criteria first-pass|reworked]
 *
 * Which of the two things happens is `delivery.mode`, not a judgement call made
 * per session: `pr` opens a pull request and lets the reconciler move the
 * ticket, `direct` rebases, fast-forwards the target and pushes. A solo project
 * configures `direct` once and never argues with a review gate again.
 *
 * *Where* it lands is `delivery.base`, falling back to `branch.base` — also
 * configuration, and for the same reason. Note the two are different questions:
 * `branch.base` is where a ticket branch is forked from, `delivery.base` where
 * it is delivered to, and a project can legitimately fork from `main` while
 * merging into `develop`.
 *
 * Dry run unless `--apply`. The dry run is a courtesy, not a proof — this repo
 * has shipped a write path whose plan was perfect and whose command the API
 * rejected, so `--apply` is the only thing that demonstrates the write works.
