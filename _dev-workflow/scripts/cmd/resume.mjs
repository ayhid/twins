/**
 * Pick a ticket back up: put the working copy back, and say what was left there.
 *
 *   dev.mjs resume [ISSUE-ID] [--repo PATH] [--print]
 *
 * `status --all` already says a ticket is in flight with N dirty files. What it
 * cannot say is *which* files, or what was already committed — and after a
 * session ends, or a compaction, that is precisely the context that is gone.
 * This prints both, off the branch itself, so resuming does not start with a
 * guess about what the last session had been doing.
 *
 * It repairs two things and invents nothing:
 *
 *   - **A missing worktree.** The branch survives a worktree removed by hand,
 *     or one taken down on a machine this checkout was cloned from. Re-mounting
 *     it goes through `startWork`, the same path `start` uses, which reuses an
 *     existing branch — a branch that does not exist is `start`'s job, and this
 *     says so rather than creating one behind your back.
 *   - **A ticket behind its branch.** A branch exists, so the work is started;
 *     a ticket still sitting in the backlog is drift. It is moved to the start
 *     rung, forward only, exactly the rule `sync` applies — a ticket already at
 *     review or done, or parked off the ladder, is left alone and reported.
 *
 * `--print` reports and repairs nothing, which is what makes it safe to run
 * against someone else's branch.
