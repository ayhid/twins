/**
 * Build the payloads an adversarial review runs on.
 *
 *   dev.mjs review                 this branch against the branch it lands on
 *   dev.mjs review --base main     against an explicit ref
 *   dev.mjs review --out DIR       write the payloads there (default: a temp dir)
 *   dev.mjs review --no-intent     skip the tracker read
 *
 * This command exists for the reason CLAUDE.md gives for every other one: the
 * three payloads are eight or nine tool calls of git and tracker work that
 * produce the same bytes every time, and a session that derives them by hand
 * pays a whole context read per turn to do it. Deriving them here costs one.
 *
 * It writes files rather than printing the diff. A diff printed to stdout lands
 * in the session's context and is then paid for on every subsequent turn — the
 * blind lens in particular must be read by a *fresh* agent, so putting it in
 * this session's context is both expensive and self-defeating.
 *
 * The three payloads differ in what they contain, and that is the whole design:
 *
 *   change.diff   the patch. Every lens gets this.
 *   context.txt   full source of the changed files. Edge and audit lenses.
 *   intent.md     the ticket. Audit lens only, and never the blind one.
 *
 * Reports and never writes to the tracker.
