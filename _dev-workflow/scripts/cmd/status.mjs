 *   dev.mjs status          this checkout: branch, ticket, state, PR, tree
 *   dev.mjs status --all    every worktree and every ticket in flight
 *   dev.mjs status --repo P restrict to one configured repo
 *
 * This reports and never writes. `sync` is the one that moves tickets, and it
 * stays separate on purpose: a command people run to orient themselves must be
 * safe to run without thinking, including on someone else's branch.
 *
 * It also degrades rather than failing. Without the GitHub CLI the PR columns
 * read `-` and everything else still prints, because "I cannot reach GitHub" is
 * not a reason to refuse to say which branch you are on. Exit code is 0 unless
 * the project is not configured at all — the precedent `version` sets.
