/**
 * What version of the workflow is installed here, and is there a newer one?
 *
 *   dev.mjs version              installed vs latest, plus files you have edited
 *   dev.mjs version --json       the same, machine-readable
 *   dev.mjs version --offline    skip the network check entirely
 *   dev.mjs version --upgrade    run the installer to bring the payload up to date
 *
 * **Named `version`, not `upgrade`.** `update` already means "write to the issue
 * tracker" and lives one row away in dev.mjs's command table; `update` and
 * `upgrade` differ by one letter, and a mistyped verb that rewrites 25 files
 * instead of moving a ticket is not a mistake worth making possible. The action
 * is an explicit flag on a read-only noun instead.
 *
 * Three rules this file exists to hold:
 *
 * 1. **Offline is not an error.** A failed check prints "unknown" and exits 0.
 *    dev.mjs turns a throw into exit 1, and a skill reading that would conclude
 *    the command is broken because the user is on a plane.
 * 2. **Nothing here writes.** `--upgrade` spawns the real installer, which owns
 *    `isOwnedPath` and the delete pass. Duplicating that boundary into every
 *    consumer's project is precisely what the boundary exists to prevent.
 * 3. **The version is read back.** After an upgrade the manifest is re-read and
 *    the version *found* is reported, never the one that was asked for.
